    label: An ensemble model developed by AmbrosM
    summary: "Ensemble comprised of four models: a py-boost model, an ExtraTrees model, and two recommender system models."
    description: |
      An ensemble of four models for single-cell perturbation prediction: 
      Py-boost (a ridge regression-based recommender system),
      ExtraTrees (a decision tree ensemble with target-encoded features),
      a k-nearest neighbors recommender system, and a ridge regression model. 
      Each model offered distinct strengths and weaknesses: ExtraTrees and
      knn were unable to extrapolate beyond the training data, while ridge
      regression provided extrapolation capability. To enhance model performance,
      data augmentation techniques were used, including averaging differential
      expressions for compound mixtures and adjusting cell counts to reduce biases.
      The final ensemble combined predictions from all models, achieving competitive
      scores in cross-validation and the leaderboard.
